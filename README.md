This culinary application, developed in Angular, offers a seamless experience for searching recipes through an external API. Users can enter keywords to discover meal inspiration, view detailed recipe information such as ingredients, preparation time, and dietary types. Each recipe can be added to favorites, with all saved recipes stored in LocalStorage to remain accessible even after refreshing the page.
